"""
This is the best place to start if you plan on building a plugin.

If you are making commits to this file, please be extra careful to add descriptive comments.

The NetWeaverPlugin class must be inherited by any plugin. Any class marked with "PLUGIN_OVERRIDE" 
is a skeleton method intended to be implemented by a plugin.

There are a few different archetypes of each set function:

All methods must have execute and it must default to True. IF execute is true, run and apply the command immediately
Otherwise just return the line(s) needed to run the command

Set methods that set a single string value per appliance (I.E. setting NTP timezone)

These methods must accept the following arguments:

:param timezone_value:
	The string that the timezone will be set to

:param delete:
	Removes the string if True, defaults to false

Set methods that set a single list value per appliance (I.E. setting DNS server list)

:param dns_servers_value:
	List of DNS servers to add

:param delete:
	If delete is true, and value parameter is empty, remove the whole list.
	IF delete is true, and value parameter a list or dict (depending on the datatype of the function) delete the values in it
	Even if a single value is requested to be deleted, it will be marshaled into the datatype the method usually accpets (List, Dict, etc)

Set methods that operate on interfaces have additional positional paraemeters:

:param speed: 
	The speed or type of interface (I.E. 1G, 10G, bond, etc)

:interface:
	The number of the interface in dstate (you will probably need a mapper function as part of your plugin to translate this
	to the value utilized by your appliance)
	vlans


Boolean functions

Boolean functions only have a True or False, so they inherently handle deletions on their own. Their state is either 
true or false (I.E. set_portfast)
